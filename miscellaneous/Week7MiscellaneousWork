On Wedneday I watched two youtube videos that went over animating sprites in Unity as well as introducing how to create transitions between different animations for the same object.

On Sunday I watched another video on youtube that covered implementing scripts to handle transitions between different animations for the same object based off of keyboard input. I met up with my group members trying to discuss some ideas for the project.We also went over some the code and started trying to implement abilities.
