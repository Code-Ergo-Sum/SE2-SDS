Customer: TB-RPG
Team: Random Cocktail Generator
Week: Monday October 17th to Sunday October 23rd


State of the Project:
The project continues to come along nicely. I learned that the design team lost a week's worth of work due, but can recover it.

Was I shown a working prototype?
Yes, I saw a prototype for showing drinks based on what's in the fridge, and for getting a random recipe.

How well did the project follow my priorities in the previous week?
I didn't see any development on user stories – Tyler didn't get a chance to do them (was busy over the weekend with Hackathan). I didn't see any selection of what sounds will be in the application. We did discuss the idea of putting the app into alpha/beta testing – we're tabling the idea for now until the application is in a much more fully formed state.


Priorities for next week
Create a prototype for generating a random cockatil (not based on fridge or from a list of recipes – truly random).

Some more priroities from last week: Finish up on the user stories. Find a list of candidate sound effects for when the user clicks a button. I like the sound of a wine bottle being opened, but I also like sci-fi spacey sounds like the Star Trek ship rdtaking off.
