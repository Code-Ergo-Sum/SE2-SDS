Customer: TB-RPG
Team: Random Cocktail Generator
Week: Moday September 19th to Sunday September 25th


State of the Project: 
The RCG project is coming along nicely â€“ in fact it has caught up to its implementation and design goals. Their team still continues to communicate with each other well, meeting outside of class each week. Each member has well defined roles in that they can all contribute to the project in their own way.

They made some great gains with how everything will look. Their front-end is almost fully designed, but needs to be more specific.


Was I shown a working prototype? 
yes

How well did the project follow my priorities in the previous week?
Pretty well. I can see they understand how the back-end will interface with the front-end. Also, although they still have more front-end designing to do, they made some great gains over the week.


Priorities For Next Week:
For Backend
- Put smoothies in mixer list table
- Flesh out columns for  mixer list table (color, naming stuff, theming stuff)

For Phone App (Danny)
- simplify code (putting things into functions)
- keep working on proof-of-concept code

For Designers
- Come up with Sci-Fi theming terms to throw into cocktail names
- Names of Sci-Fi writers,characters, places, sci-fi sounding things
- SciFi sounding things "___obulator" , "___ 2000", etc, but not just suffixes, prefixes, and stuff that can go in the middle of the name.
- Continue designing front-end
